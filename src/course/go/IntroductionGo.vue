      </ul>

      <!-- Writing Your First Go Program -->
      <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Writing Your First Go Program</h2>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
        Let's dive into writing a simple "Hello, World!" program in Go. This will help you understand the basic structure and syntax of the language.
      </p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded-md overflow-x-auto mb-6">
<code>
// Example: Hello World in Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
</code>
      </pre>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        **Explanation:**
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>package main:</strong> Defines the package name. The <code>main</code> package is the starting point of a Go program.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>import "fmt":</strong> Imports the <code>fmt</code> package, which contains functions for formatted I/O, such as printing to the console.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>func main() { ... }:</strong> The <code>main</code> function is the entry point of the program where execution begins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>fmt.Println("Hello, World!"): </strong> Calls the <code>Println</code> function from the <code>fmt</code> package to output the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        **Running the Program:**
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        <li>Create a new file named <code>hello.go</code>.</li>

      <!-- Go's Features: Garbage Collection and Concurrency Model -->
      <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Go's Features: Garbage Collection and Concurrency Model</h2>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
        Go introduces several modern features that set it apart from other programming languages. Two of the most notable are its garbage collection and concurrency model.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Garbage Collection</h3>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
        Go incorporates an efficient garbage collector, which automatically manages memory by reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. This feature eliminates the need for manual memory management, reducing the risk of memory leaks and pointer-related errors common in languages like C and C++.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        **Benefits of Garbage Collection in Go:**
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Prevents memory leaks and dangling pointers by automatically freeing unused memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Developer Productivity:</strong> Allows developers to focus on writing logic without worrying about manual memory management.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Go's garbage collector is optimized for low-latency and high-throughput applications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Concurrency Model</h3>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
        Concurrency is a core aspect of Go, enabling developers to build applications that can perform multiple operations simultaneously. Go introduces the concept of **goroutines** and **channels** to facilitate concurrent programming.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        **Goroutines:**
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        <li>
          Lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created using the <code>go</code> keyword followed by a function call, e.g., <code>go functionName()</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thousands of goroutines can run concurrently without significant overhead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        **Channels:**
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        <li>
          Facilitate communication between goroutines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow goroutines to send and receive values of a specified type, ensuring safe data exchange.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support synchronization and coordination between concurrent operations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        **Example of Concurrency in Go:**
      </p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded-md overflow-x-auto mb-6">
<code>
// Example: Concurrency with Goroutines and Channels
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func greet(name string, ch chan string) {
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    message := fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s!", name)
    ch <- message
}

func main() {
    channel := make(chan string)

    go greet("Alice", channel)
    go greet("Bob", channel)

    // Receive messages from the channel
    msg1 := <-channel
    msg2 := <-channel

    fmt.Println(msg1)
    fmt.Println(msg2)
}
</code>
      </pre>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        **Explanation:**
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>greet Function:</strong> Simulates a delay using <code>time.Sleep</code> and sends a greeting message to the channel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Goroutines:</strong> Two goroutines are created to greet "Alice" and "Bob" concurrently.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Channels:</strong> Used to receive the greeting messages from the goroutines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Output:</strong> The program prints both greeting messages, demonstrating concurrent execution.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
        **Sample Output:**
      </p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded-md overflow-x-auto mb-6">
<code>
// Sample Output:
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
